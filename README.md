# Toposoid Community Edition
Toposoid is a knowledge base construction platform.
Toposoid has the following features.
* You can build a knowledge base just by entering sentences (Currently only supports Japanese and English).
* If you enter the text as it is, you can search the knowledge base and obtain inference results.
* This inferring program is designed so that developers can freely extend and replace it in their favorite programming language.

In this repository, it is published as Toposoid Community Edition. For more information -> https://toposoid.com/

## Requirements
* Docker version 20.10.x, or later
* docker-compose version 1.22.x

## Recommended environment
* Required: at least 8GB of RAM (The maximum heap memory size of the JVM is set to 6G (Application: 4G, Neo4J: 2G))
* Required: 65G or higher of HDD

## Setup
```bssh
docker-compose up -d
```
* It takes more than 20 minutes to pull the Docker image for the first time.
* If vald does not start due to an error, after deleting the files directly under vald-config/backup, commenting out the following part in docker-compose.yml may work.
```yml
  vald:
    image: vdaas/vald-agent-ngt:v1.6.3
    #user: 1000:1000
    volumes:
      - ./vald-config:/etc/server
      #- /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro
      #- /etc/group:/etc/group:ro
    networks:
      app_net:
        ipv4_address: 172.30.0.10
    ports:
      - 8081:8081
```


## Usage
```bash
# Regist knowledge

## Deduction's Example
### An example of a logic puzzle called a liar game

* Demo Web Application https://toposoid-service.com/

There are three people, A, B, and C, two honest people and the other one is a liar. And all three know who is honest and who is a liar. Here, an honest person is a person who always says the truth, and a liar is a person who always says the opposite of the truth. At this time, the following testimonies of A, B, and C were obtained.
* A's testimony: C is a liar.
* B's testimony: A is honest.
* C's testimony: B is a liar.
  Based on these testimonies, follow these steps to determine who is a liar.

This problem can be defined by one regulation and three hypothesis.
### regulation
* (A AND B AND NOT C) OR (A AND NOT B AND C) OR (NOT A AND B AND C)

## Note
* If you want to run in a remote environment or a virtual environment, change PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS in docker-compose.yml according to your environment.
* The memory allocated to Neo4J can be adjusted with NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_max__size in docker-compose.yml.
* Services provided by Toposoid are accessible on port 4444
