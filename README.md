# Toposoid Community Edition
Toposoid is a knowledge base construction platform.
Toposoid has the following features.
* You can build a knowledge base just by entering sentences (Currently only supports Japanese and English).
* If you enter the text as it is, you can search the knowledge base and obtain inference results.
* This inferring program is designed so that developers can freely extend and replace it in their favorite programming language.

In this repository, it is published as Toposoid Community Edition. For more information -> https://toposoid.com/

## Requirements
* Docker version 24.0.x, or later
* docker-compose version 1.25.x

## Recommended environment For Standalone
* Required: at least 32GB of RAM
* Required: at least 100G of HDD(Total required Docker Image size)
* Please understand that since we are dealing with large models such as LLM, the Dockerfile size is large and the required machine SPEC is high.

## Setup For Standalone
```bssh
docker-compose up
```
* It takes more than 30 minutes to pull the Docker image for the first time.

## Usage
* Try accessing http://localhost:4444 in your browser.
* The UI has been confirmed to work only on Chrome browser.
### Knowledge data registration. You can register both text and images.

Try accessing http://localhost:7474 in your browser.
You will be able to see the data you registered from the API.
as follows

### Deduction's Example
* During inference, it is possible to select units accordingly. Please set from the screen below.

### An example of a logic puzzle called a liar game

* Demo Web Application https://toposoid-service.com/

There are three people, A, B, and C, two honest people and the other one is a liar. And all three know who is honest and who is a liar. Here, an honest person is a person who always says the truth, and a liar is a person who always says the opposite of the truth. At this time, the following testimonies of A, B, and C were obtained.
* A's testimony: C is a liar.
* B's testimony: A is honest.
* C's testimony: B is a liar.
  Based on these testimonies, follow these steps to determine who is a liar.

This problem can be defined by one regulation and three hypothesis.
### regulation
* (A AND B AND NOT C) OR (A AND NOT B AND C) OR (NOT A AND B AND C)
